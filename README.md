 Task-2-karthik
I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly. I began by generating summary statistics to understand the central tendencies and spread of the data. I visualized distributions of numerical features using histograms and boxplots, which helped identify outliers and skewness. I explored feature relationships using pairplots and a correlation heatmap, which provided insights into inter-feature dependencies. Additionally, I analyzed survival patterns based on gender and passenger class through bar plots. The EDA helped uncover important trends — such as higher survival rates among females and first-class passengers — and highlighted patterns in age, fare, and family-related variables. The final cleaned dataset was saved for future modeling tasks.
